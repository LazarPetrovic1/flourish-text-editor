# BIG_PROBLEMS

1. ***Saving a file reloads the whole application***

*Example:* ![Gif called save-file in public/todo](todo/save-file.gif)

**Note:** The save goes through without a problem, but the reload messes with the UX.

2. ***Lower level directories are interpreted as files (by React)***

*Example:* ![Gif called dir-files in public/todo](todo/dir-files.gif)

3. ***Closing tabs after all are closed triggers an error***

*Example:* ![Gif called multiple-close in public/todo](todo/multiple-close.gif)

4. ***Add "Save As", "Reopen last item", "Reopen project" and other features found in other editors***

5. ***Add a THANK_YOU.md file for dependency authors***
