# BIG_PROBLEMS

1. ***Saving a file reloads the whole application***

*Example:* ![Gif called save-file in the same dir](todo/save-file.gif)

**Note:** The save goes through without a problem, but the reload messes with the UX.

2. ***Lower level directories are interpreted as files (by React)***

*Example:* ![Gif called dir-files in the same dir](todo/dir-files.gif)

3. ***Add "Save As", "Reopen last item", "Reopen project" and other features found in other editors***
